# Possible Future Improvements

## UI Updates

- Add published at date to Bites
- Add a last refresh/next refresh banner at the top of page
- Collapsible bites
- Side scrollable word badges on mobile
- Retain scroll position on bite updates and refreshes

## Users

- Adding the concept of user accounts to the application, such that bites are not across all visitors to the page
  - Will require the structure of BiteCache to be updated.
